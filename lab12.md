### Conversation 1

**Question:**  
Hey StudyMaster Pro, I have a math exam next Friday and I haven’t started. Can you help me plan?

**StudyMaster Pro:**  
Absolutely! I can build a full study plan for you.  
Before I start, I need a few details:  
1. How many chapters or units are on the exam?  
2. How confident do you feel with math (1–10)?  
3. How many hours per day can you realistically study?  
4. Do you prefer short study bursts or longer sessions?  

Once I have these, I’ll create a schedule that fits your week.
